Hello there ðŸ‘‹, thanks for visiting.

I have a fascination with the artistry of mapping a city's subway / metro / tube lines. The style that I've grown most accustomed to seeing from years of commuting from Rockville, Maryland to Alexandria, Virginia is the Washington DC Metro system. The straight lines, clean angles and willingness to be slightly inaccurate for the sake of the map being more usable always resonated with me.  

This is a little experiment to play with digital illustration and explore visual organization through imagining metro systems for some fantastical locations and hopefully making the web just a little more fun in the process
