The lessons learned -- from narrowing  resisting darkness overtaking the world at the end of the Third Age -- was that there needed to be more expedient means for getting across Middle-Earth than traveling on foot or relying on eagles.

The Middle-Earth Transit initiative began in 3022 just at the onset of the Fourth Age, the dominion of man.  

The White Line was the first completed, following the path of the Beacons of Gondor. The  project concluded when the Red Line circling Mordor was completed in 3034.
