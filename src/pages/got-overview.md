The Westro transit project was the Spring of 308AC with the White Line across the wall and finished in 322AC with the extension of the Blue Line out to the Step Stones.

Westro Metro was conceived by the people of Westeros as a more pragmatic approach for uniting the Seven Kingdoms after the fall of most of the major houses during the Game of Thrones.
