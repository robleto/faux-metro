A metro system in Oz would make travel faster and safer, avoiding treks through deadly poppies, enchanted forests, and Kalidah-infested woods. Instead of long walks on winding brick roads, passengers could zip between cities without fear of falling asleep in cursed fields or dodging angry trees.

With cheerful, magical trains connecting places like Munchkinland and the Emerald City, Ozians could explore without worrying about weather or witchcraft. No more rusting in the rain or losing your way in spooky woodsâ€”just a smooth ride to your next adventure!
